# Bathroom Problem
Operating system & semaphores

## question details:
lets assume there are 6 bathroom in dorm and 100 student. when they want to use the bathroom they go inside and lock the door. we provide this service or locking mechanism with semaphores. for example when first guy arrive, he uses one of six bathroom. then second guy uses other one. so it goes on until the 7th guy, when he arrive he wait until the one of occupied become available. 

In this project, we use treat and semaphores to create the system. we create 6 seamphores and 100 treats.
